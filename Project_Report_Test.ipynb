    "With the ability to confidently classify whether a star is pulsar or not, scientists could make enourmous strides in astronomy. By weeding out the fake pulsars and focusing only on the real ones, scientists can more accurately study what is happening inside real pulsars. Since neutron stars (which pulsars are) are the densest material in the universe, studying them can lead to enourmous discoveries related to the physics of the universe. Also, by weeding out the fake pulsars, scientists can focus in on the real pulsars and calculate cosmic distances.  This is because pulsar stars blink at regular intervals rivaled only by atomic clocks (https://www.space.com/32661-pulsars.html).  Overall, the ability to accurately predict whether a \"pulsar event\" in data is real or just interference is a major step in studying the universe beyond our own planet.\n",

    "Also, we must question if there are more accurate predictor variables that would work better? This also brings up, can we tune equipement in the field to also track in real time whether a reading is real or interference and filter it right away so scientists don't need to study it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this is just a predictive algorithm to determine if it is pulsar or interference, we must question the validity of the data and if the scientists behind it accurately classified the pulsars."
